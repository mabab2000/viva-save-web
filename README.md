### Environment Variables

The frontend uses `https://viva-api-5d4f.onrender.com/api` by default. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` to configure it. Set `VITE_APP_BASE_URL` to a full API URL (including `/api`) to override the backend; dashboard WebSocket updates use the same host. Rebuild the frontend after changing this variable.

```env
VITE_APP_BASE_URL=https://viva-api-5d4f.onrender.com/api
VITE_APP_NAME=SaveTracker
VITE_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
NODE_ENV=production
